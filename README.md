##Application Name: 
CX360

##Elevator Pitch
**********************************************

CX360 could be applied to an existing application when a customer is in need of support. This idea comes from my personal experiences within the call center and the advance repair departments. Customers would call into Tier 1 seeking assistance with an issue, in some cases those issues were more complex and were unable to be resolved by the ITG's and did not require a technician in the home. It would get escalated to the Tier 1.5 ATS/Tier 2 teams for back-end investigation.

Many times I personally heard from customers that their thought when given a ticket number and told someone would call in 24-72 hours, they assumed they were getting blown off, until someone called them to their surprise. 24-72 hours can seem quite a long time when you are anxiously awaiting a fix for an existing issue. 

I would like to provide the option for the customer to see their ticket progress, much like you would see the progress on a package being delivered to your home. With our company working more remote during these times and trying to resolve issues without having to be inside our customers home unless necessary, they could see that their issue is being cared for by seeing updates when the ticket was being worked and what the next steps were. This could improve the customer experience as well as lead to higher NPS scores. They get the peace of mind that we are caring for them without having to call or resort to social media asking for updates or re-escalate and potentially end up as a Corporate escalation. This could lead to less repeat calls/social media inquiries as well.
